        <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am a 26 year old male originally from Colorado. I sold my house and moved to Seattle to pursue software engineering in January 0f 2020.
                 Prior to the move I had lived in Colorado my entire life. I enjoy pretty much anything outdoors, including hunting, hiking, and playing sports.
                 I have two older brothers and one older sister. My siblings are spread out all over the country.</p>
                 <br>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>My long-term goals are to finish an emmersive coding bootcamp at CodeFellows in Seattle. 
                Once this schooling is finished I am hoping to attain employment at any one of numerous tech companies.
